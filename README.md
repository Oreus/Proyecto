# Proyecto Music Finder
This project will be a coding project that will have the function of finding a song based on user given parameters. I chose this project because I wanted to create a way for people to be able to find music similar to the ones they already enjoy listening to. The user will put into the program a genre and other specifiers for the type of music they want to find. The program will then evaluate those specifiers, and compare that with its data base to then give the user recommened songs based on the algorithm.

The program will funcion by accessing a data base of songs that I will provide for it. The user will then put into the program the genre of the music they wish to find. The prorgram will also ask them for other criteria, such as song length, artist, or realease year. The program will then take the information that was given to it, and use that set of parameters to search the given data base for results matching the request. The program will then give between 1-5 results based on how many songs within the database match the request.

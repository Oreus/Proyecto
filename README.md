# Proyecto Music Finder
This project will be a coding project that will have the function of finding a song based on user given parameters. The user will put into the program a genre and other specifiers for the type of music they want to find. The program will then ecaluate those specifiers, and compare that with its data base to then give the user recommened songs based on the algorithm.
